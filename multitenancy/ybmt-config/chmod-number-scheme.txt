chmod number scheme
-------------------

  r => 4
  w => 2
  x => 1
  - => 0

Example 1:

    u   g   a
   --- --- ---
  -rw- r-- r--
   420 400 400
   \_/
       \_/

Example 2:

  r + w + x = 4+2+1 = 7
  r + _ + x = 4+0+1 = 5
  r + _ + _ = 4+0+0 = 4

  => 0754

This is usually written as just:

   chmod 754 < the file (pattern) >
