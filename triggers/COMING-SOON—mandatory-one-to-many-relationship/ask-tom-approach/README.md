# "ask-tom-approach"

This file is a placeholder. It serves to preserve the parent directory:

```
/ysql-case-studies/triggers/COMING-SOONâ€”mandatory-one-to-many-relationship/ask-tom-approach/
```

It's a feature of _git_ that it doesn't preserve an empty directory when you push from one instance of a particular repo to another of its instances. But an empty directory carries information in that it signals planned work that remains to be done.

This file preserves the otherwise empty _"ask-tom-approach"_ directory when the local _git_ clone of this repo (where the repo content is developed) is merged back into the Internet-visible [main](https://github.com/YugabyteDB-Samples/ysql-case-studies) instance.

This case study will focus on an implementation of the approach that's described by the famous Oracle Database expert Tom Kyte (now retired) in the post [Mandatory Relationships between tables](https://asktom.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=100:11:0::::P11_QUESTION_ID:22885524653897).
