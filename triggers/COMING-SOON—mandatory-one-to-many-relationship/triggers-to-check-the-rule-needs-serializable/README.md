# "triggers-to-check-the-rule-needs-serializable"

This file is a placeholder. It serves to preserve the parent directory:

```
/ysql-case-studies/triggers/COMING-SOONâ€”mandatory-one-to-many-relationship/triggers-to-check-the-rule-needs-serializable/
```

It's a feature of _git_ that it doesn't preserve an empty directory when you push from one instance of a particular repo to another of its instances. But an empty directory carries information in that it signals planned work that remains to be done.

This file preserves the otherwise empty _"triggers-to-check-the-rule-needs-serializable"_ directory when the local _git_ clone of this repo (where the repo content is developed) is merged back into the Internet-visible [main](https://github.com/YugabyteDB-Samples/ysql-case-studies) instance.
